# Inference for Stan model: heights_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.030, 0.029, 0.030, 0.032) seconds, 0.12 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.052, 0.046, 0.040, 0.052) seconds, 0.19 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
