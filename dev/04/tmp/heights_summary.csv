# Inference for Stan model: heights_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.018, 0.019, 0.018, 0.018) seconds, 0.072 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.032, 0.027, 0.028, 0.021) seconds, 0.11 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
