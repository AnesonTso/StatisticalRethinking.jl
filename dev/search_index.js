It is my intention to study those and possibly include quap or ulam (or both) in a future of Statisticalrethinking.\nSeveral other interesting approaches that could become a good basis for such an endeavour are being explored in Julia, e.g. Soss.jl and Omega.jl.\nMany other R functions such as precis(), link(), shade(), etc. are not in v1, although some very early versions are being tested. Expect significant refactoring of those in future versions.\nThe Mamba examples should really use @everywhere using Mamba in stead of using Mamba. This was done to get around a limitation in Literate.jl to test the notebooks when running in distributed mode. \nIn the src directory of all packages is a file scriptentry.jl which defines an object script_dict which is used to control the generation of documentation, notebooks and .jl scripts in chapters and testing of the notebooks. See ?ScriptEntry or enter e.g. script_dict[\"02\"] in the REPL. In the model packages this file is suffixed by an indication of the used mcmc option. e.g. script_dict_d in DynamicHMCModels.\nA utility function, generate() is part of each package to regenerate notebooks and chapter scripts, please see ?generate. Again, e.g. generate_t in TuringModels generates all model notebooks and chapter scripts for Turing models.\nIn a similar fashion, borrowed from DynamicHMCExamples I define several variations on rel_path(). By itself, rel_path() points at the scr directory of StatisticalRethinking.jl and e.g. rel_path_s() points to the src directory of StanModels. The rel_path() version is typically used to read in data files. All others are used to locate directorres to read from or store generated files into.","category":"page"},{"location":"acknowledgements.html#Acknowledgements-1","page":"Acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"acknowledgements.html#Acknowledgements-2","page":"Acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"acknowledgements.html#","page":"Acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"Richard Torkar has taken the lead in developing the Turing versions of the models in chapter 8 and subsequent chapters.
