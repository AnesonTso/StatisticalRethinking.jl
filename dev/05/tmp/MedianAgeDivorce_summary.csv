# Inference for Stan model: MedianAgeDivorce_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.047, 0.047, 0.047, 0.046) seconds, 0.19 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.062, 0.065, 0.062, 0.062) seconds, 0.25 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
