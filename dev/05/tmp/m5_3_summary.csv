# Inference for Stan model: m5_3_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.086, 0.085, 0.092, 0.085) seconds, 0.35 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.11, 0.093, 0.095, 0.095) seconds, 0.39 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
