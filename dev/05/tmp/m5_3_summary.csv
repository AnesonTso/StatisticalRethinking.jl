# Inference for Stan model: m5_3_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.090, 0.084, 0.084, 0.079) seconds, 0.34 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.096, 0.084, 0.096, 0.086) seconds, 0.36 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
