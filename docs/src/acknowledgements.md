## Acknowledgements

Of course, without this excellent textbook by Richard McElreath, this package would not have been possible. The author has also been supportive of this work and gave permission to use the datasets.

Richard Torkar has taken the lead in developing the Turing versions of the models in chapter 8 and subsequent chapters. 

Tamas Papp has been very helpful during the development of the DynamicHMC versions of the models.

The TuringLang team and #turing contributors on Slack have been extremely helpful! The Turing examples by Cameron Pfiffer are followed closely in several example scripts.

The initial approach of using Literate.jl to generate .md files and Jupyter notebooks has been dropped in this version. Please let me know if that functionality is missed.
