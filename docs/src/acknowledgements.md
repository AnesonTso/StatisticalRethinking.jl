Richard Torkar has taken the lead in developing the Turing versions of the models in chapter 8. 

The TuringLang team and #turing contributors on Slack have been extremely helpful! The Turing examples by Cameron Pfiffer have been a great help and followed closely in several example scripts.

The  documentation has been generated using Literate.jl and Documenter.jl based on several ideas demonstrated by Tamas Papp in above mentioned  [DynamicHMCExamples.jl](https://tpapp.github.io/DynamicHMCExamples.jl).
