### snippet 0.5 is replaced by below `using StatisticalRethinking`.

```@example clip-04-05
using StatisticalRethinking, GLM
gr(size=(500, 500));
```

### snippet 0.4

Below `dataset(...)` provides access to often used R datasets.
If this is not a common R dataset, see the chapter 4 snippets.

```@example clip-04-05
cars = dataset("datasets", "cars");
first(cars, 5)
```

Fit a linear regression of distance on speed

```@example clip-04-05
m = lm(@formula(Dist ~ Speed), cars)
```

estimated coefficients from the model

```@example clip-04-05
coef(m)
```

Plot residuals against speed

```@example clip-04-05; continued = true
scatter( cars[:Speed], residuals(m),
  xlab="Speed", ylab="Model residual values", lab="Model residuals")
```
