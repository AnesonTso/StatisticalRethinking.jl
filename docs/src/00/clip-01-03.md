Load Julia packages (libraries) needed  for the snippets in chapter 0

```@example clip-01-03
using StatisticalRethinking
```

### snippet 0.1

```@example clip-01-03
println( "All models are wrong, but some are useful." );
```

### snippet 0.2

This is a StepRange, not a vector

```@example clip-01-03
x = 1:3
```

Below still preserves the StepRange

```@example clip-01-03
x = x*10
```

`Broadcast` log to steprange elements in x, this returms a vector!
Notice the log.(x) notation.

```@example clip-01-03
x = log.(x)
```

We can sum the vector x

```@example clip-01-03
x = sum(x)
```

Etc.

```@example clip-01-03
x = exp(x)
x = x*10
x = log(x)
x = sum(x)
x = exp(x)
```

### snippet 0.3

```@example clip-01-03
[log(0.01^200) 200 * log(0.01)]
```
