## Installation

This package can be installed from the REPL as follows:

```
] add StatisticalRethinking
[del] 
```

While working throught the book/snippets I suggest:

```
] dev StatisticalRethinking
```

This puts the package source code in your development subdirectory which I find is easier to use from within an editor.
