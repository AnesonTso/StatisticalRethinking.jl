## StatisticalRethinkingJulia Github organization

StatisticalRethinking.jl is part of the broader [StatisticalRethinkingJulia](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia) Github organization.

Implementations of the models using Stan, DynamicHMC and Turing can be found in [StanModels](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StanModels.jl), [DynamicHMCModels](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/DynamicHMCModels.jl) and [TuringModels](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/TuringModels.jl).

StanModels has been updated to use the new suite of packages StanSample.jl, StanOptimize.jl, StanVariational.jl, etc. (all modeled after Tamas Papp's StanDump.jl, StanRun.jl and StanSamples.jl). 

While work on StatisticalRethinking.jl v1.x will continue for at least 
several more months, work on a v2 has also started by testing a new formulation for the models based on Soss.jl and DynamicHMC.jl, i.e. [SossModels.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/SossModels.jl).
